I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove. I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!</p>",

The love and spirit for the Middle East has not been seen like this in a thousand years! It is a beautiful thing to behold!

Also, I would like to thank the great and powerful country of Indonesia, and its wonderful leader, for all of the help they have shown and given to the Middle East, and to the U.S.A.

Jack is a man who will bring costs and prices down, rapidly, but in particular, Energy costs, because he knows that everything else will follow. Mikie Sherrill, on the contrary, has Energy policies and concepts that will double and triple prices in New Jersey. Unlike Jack, there have been no calls to Washington saying, “What do we do with these rapidly rising Electric and other costs?” I have brought Energy way down, with Gasoline soon to hit $2, with everything else following! If Mikie, who was essentially thrown out of her school for cheating, and wasn’t even allowed to walk through the Graduating Class, is ever involved with Government, Energy prices will soar at a record level! Unlike Jack Ciattarelli, nobody from her group is calling the White House in order to take advantage of the record drops in overall Energy costs. Jack Ciattarelli is a good man, who understands business, and who will bring down Energy, and other costs, by 50%, and even more. The unusually named Mikie, perhaps her only asset, will drive Energy costs up, like no Governor in History.
